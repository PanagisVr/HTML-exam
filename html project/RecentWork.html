    The September 2007 issue of Cell had a cover drawn by Araki with a ligase represented as one of his Stands. In 2008, Araki drew the cover art for a collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata's short story "The Dancing Girl of Izu". He drew the cover for the limited edition of Base Ball Bear's "Breeeeze Girl" single, which actually takes an image from the JoJo manga.
    Also in 2009, Hirohiko Araki was one of five artists selected by the Musée du Louvre to create original works set at the famous museum. His piece Rohan at the Louvre starred JoJo's Rohan Kishibe and was shown at the exhibit titled Le Louvre invite la bande dessinée ("The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art"), which was created to show the diversity of comics, from January 19 to April 13. Rohan at the Louvre was highly praised. The following year, Rohan at the Louvre was published in France and ran in Japan's Ultra Jump. It was released in the US by NBM Publishing in February 2012.
    From September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur "Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, JoJo's creator, and the fashion magazine Spur. The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki; including actual pieces of the brand's own 2011-2012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs. For Spur, Araki drew Kishibe Rohan meets Gucci., a full-color one-shot featuring Rohan Kishibe that ran in its October 2011 issue. Spur once again ran a JoJo spinoff by Araki, Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6, in their February 2013 issue. A free English translation is available on Gucci's Facebook page.
    To raise awareness of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of the Hiraizumi ruins, that were damaged by the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June, Araki drew artwork depicting the ruins. A "Hirohiko Araki JoJo Exhibition" opened in Araki's native Sendai at the end of July 2012 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, it then moved to Tokyo in October.
    He drew the album cover for Sayuri Ishikawa's 2012 album X -Cross-, where she performs one of the series' iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga, the cover of the 2012 reprint of Tamaki Saitō's Lacan for Surviving, and the cover of the 2015 compilation album for composer Akira Senju.
    A book explaining Araki's methodology on creating manga, titled Manga in Theory and Practice (荒木飛呂彦の漫画術, Araki Hirohiko no Manga Jutsu), was released on April 17, 2015, in Japan; an English translation was later released on June 6, 2017. A stage adaptation of Araki's 1994 one-shot Under Execution, Under Jailbreak ran from November 20 to 29, 2015, at the Galaxy Theatre, then touring the country in December. The play also included elements of his 1996 one-shot Dolce, and His Master.
    Araki created an official poster for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics, titled The Sky above The Great Wave off the Coast of Kanagawa. The piece is heavily inspired by Hokusai's famous woodblock print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa.
